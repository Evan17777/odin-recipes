    <h3>Lasagna is a baked Italian dish made of layered pasta sheets, meat or vegetables, sauce (often tomato or béchamel), and cheese.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Italian sausage</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Pasta sauce</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
    </ul>  

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
        <li><strong>Pre-heat oven to 400F</strong>
            <p>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400°F</p></li>
        <li><strong>Brown the beef and onion</strong>
            <p>Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and cook, breaking the beef up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce</strong>
            <p>Open 1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups). Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture</p></li>
        <li><strong>Begin layering the lasagna</strong>
            <p>Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese if needed (3 cups). Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking dish, breaking them if needed to create a single layer (it’s OK if the noodles overlap slightly). Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over the noodles. Dollop and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the ricotta, then sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Continue layering the lasagna</strong>
            <p> Arrange 5 more noodles over the mozzarella, followed by 1 cup of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce, and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with a final layer of 5 noodles and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin so that it almost completely covers the noodles. (Reserve the remaining 1 cup mozzarella for the end of baking.) Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil</p></li>
        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour</strong>
            <p>Bake for 1 hour. Check to make sure the noodles are done by poking the lasagna with a knife; the knife should slide easily through all the layers. If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes more</p></li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking</strong>
            <p>Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake uncovered until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, and the sauce is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more</p></li>
        <li><strong>Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes</strong>
            <p>Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving</p></li>
